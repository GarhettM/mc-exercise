# Hello from the other side


  
## Im an idiot for not updating my local Git

### God Help me!!!!!

## This line simulates the work that Bob and Carole (Baskin) would do to get their feature finished. This was done on Carole's laptop

## this is the way im living and i refuse to change. I got a judgement against me down there in florida.

### this is the only way left to live... branch for each feature, acp after each feature, merge and PR after edits are agreed upon.

### or waste countless hours....

#### ME AND LINDSEY DID THIS FOR THE GREATER GOOD FOR GOD KNOW WHY. IT WAS FRUSTRATIGNG FOR ME TO WORK WITH SOME WHO IS SO CONTROLLING I WANTED TO QUIT 



# muahahahahahahah lindsey has spoken

## ME AND DAVID LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON! THE END>
